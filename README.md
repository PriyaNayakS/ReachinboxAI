ReachinboxAI is a project designed to manage email communication by organizing, displaying, and interacting with email data in a structured, user-friendly format. The system fetches emails from a data source, processes them, and displays them in a web interface.

The email data includes sender details, email body, and other metadata. Users can view the email list and interact with it using the sidebar navigation.
